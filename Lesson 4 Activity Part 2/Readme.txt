NUMBER GUESSING GAME

ACTIVITY DESCRIPTION
This activity is to create a game where the user has to guess a number that the computer has chosen.

Variations of this game will give the user different numbers of guesses to try to get the right answer, and hints to help them along.


INSTRUCTIONS
Task

Part 1: Write an application that

generates a number from 1 to 10

asks the user to guess the number

determines whether the userâ€™s guess was correct and writes the result out to the user

In this part of the activity, the user only gets one guess.

 

Part 2:

Update your code to allow the user to have a maximum of 3 guesses

Let the user know how many guesses they have left

Add code to give the user a hint. For example, your hint could be to tell them whether the number they chose was

Too high or too low

Hot (very close to the correct answer), or cold (not so close to the correct answer) 

Or whether the correct answer is even or odd

Hints:

To determine if the user has the right answer, you may want to use

an if statement, or

a switch statement

 

To give the user multiple guesses, you may want to use

a for loop, or

a while loop

 

To give the user as many guesses as they like, you may want to use

an infinite while loop

 

To break out of an infinite loop when the user has guessed the right answer, you may want to use

a break statement

 

To give the user hints about their answer, you may want to use some comparison operators
